Modular Architecture: Enables users to run xharvestor in full-spectrum.

Automated Evidence Collection: Automatically saves all findings in structured, standardized formats:

Raw Data Format: PCAP files, IQ recordings (*.bin), CAN bus logs, & etc.

Structured Reports: Comprehensive reports in HTML, JSON, and Markdown for easy integration into deliverables.

Geotagging Integration: Correlates all discovered devices and signals with GPS coordinates (when a receiver is available) for mapping and analysis.

Hardware Abstraction Layer: Simplifies the use of complex hardware (SDRs, CAN interfaces) by handling driver communication and configuration automatically.
