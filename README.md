‚ö° xharvestor is a specialized, modular Python-based reconnaissance suite designed for security assessments of radio frequency (RF), wireless(bluetooth & wifi), industrial control system(scada), and automotive systems. It integrates multiple tools and scripts into a unified workflow for probing, analyzing, and documenting findings from the physical and wireless world.
## Overview

Moving beyond traditional web OSINT, xHarvester RF allows security researchers, red teams, and penetration testers to interact with the electromagnetic spectrum. It provides a structured approach to discovering, fingerprinting, and assessing the security posture of devices ranging from WiFi routers and Bluetooth peripherals to critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and modern automobiles.

## ‚ú® Core Framework Features

Unified Command & Control: A single Python-based interface to orchestrate a wide array of specialized hardware and software tools.

Modular Architecture: Enables users to run xharvestor in full-spectrum.

Automated Evidence Collection: Automatically saves all findings in structured, standardized formats:

Raw Data: PCAP files, IQ recordings (*.bin), CAN bus logs.

Structured Reports: Comprehensive reports in HTML, JSON, and Markdown for easy integration into deliverables.

Geotagging Integration: Correlates all discovered devices and signals with GPS coordinates (when a receiver is available) for mapping and analysis.

Hardware Abstraction Layer: Simplifies the use of complex hardware (SDRs, CAN interfaces) by handling driver communication and configuration automatically.
