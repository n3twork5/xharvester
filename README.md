‚ö° xharvester is a specialized, Python-based reconnaissance and exploitation suite designed for security assessments of radio frequency (RF), wireless(bluetooth & wifi), industrial control system(scada), and automotive systems. It integrates multiple tools and scripts into a unified workflow for probing, analyzing, and documenting findings from the physical and wireless world.

## Overview
Moving beyond traditional web OSINT, xHarvester allows security researchers, red teams, and penetration testers to interact with the electromagnetic spectrum. It provides a structured approach to discovering, fingerprinting, exploiting and assessing the security posture of devices ranging from WiFi routers and Bluetooth peripherals to critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and modern automobiles vehicles.

## ‚ú® Core Framework Features
Unified Command & Control: A single Python-based interface to orchestrate a wide array of specialized hardware and software tools.

Modular Architecture: Enables users to run xharvestor in full-spectrum.

Automated Evidence Collection: Automatically saves all findings in structured, standardized formats:

Raw Data Format: PCAP files, IQ recordings (*.bin), CAN bus logs, & etc.

Structured Reports: Comprehensive reports in HTML, JSON, and Markdown for easy integration into deliverables.

Geotagging Integration: Correlates all discovered devices and signals with GPS coordinates (when a receiver is available) for mapping and analysis.

Hardware Abstraction Layer: Simplifies the use of complex hardware (SDRs, CAN interfaces) by handling driver communication and configuration automatically.
