## Overview
Moving beyond traditional web OSINT & exploitations, xharvester allows security researchers, red teams, and penetration testers to interact with the electromagnetic spectrum. It provides a structured approach to discovering, fingerprinting, exploiting and assessing the security posture of devices ranging from WiFi routers and Bluetooth peripherals to critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS), modern automotive vehicles and radio frequency(RF).

## ‚ú® Core Framework Features
Unified Command & Control: A single Python-based interface to orchestrate a wide array of specialized hardware and software tools.

Modular Architecture: Enables users to run xharvestor in full-spectrum with a key.

Automated Evidence Collection: Automatically saves all findings in structured, standardized formats:

Raw Data Format: PCAP files, IQ recordings (*.bin), CAN bus logs, & etc.

Structured Reports: Comprehensive reports in HTML, JSON, and Markdown for easy integration into deliverables.

Geotagging Integration: Correlates all discovered devices and signals with GPS coordinates (when a receiver is available) for mapping and analysis.

Hardware Abstraction Layer: Simplifies the use of complex hardware (SDRs, CAN interfaces) by handling driver communication and configuration automatically.

### Simulation for Automobile Network
Instrument Cluster Simulator for SocketCAN
------------------------------------------

By: OpenGarages <agent.craig@gmail.com>

Compiling
---------
You will need:
* SDL2
* SDL2_Image
* can-utils

You can get can-utils from github or on Ubuntu you may run the following

```
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev can-utils  
```

With dependencies installed, you may use the [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/) to build the project:

```
  meson setup builddir && cd builddir
  meson compile
```

Testing on a virtual CAN interface
----------------------------------
You can run the following commands to setup a virtual can interface

```
  sudo modprobe can
  sudo modprobe vcan
  sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
  sudo ip link set up vcan0
```

If you type ifconfig vcan0 you should see a vcan0 interface. A setup_vcan.sh file has also been provided with this
repo.

Usage
-----
Default operations:

Start the Instrument Cluster (IC) simulator:

```
  ./icsim vcan0
```

Then startup the controls

```
  ./controls vcan0
```

The hard coded defaults should be in sync and the controls should control the IC.  Ideally use a controller similar to
an XBox controller to interact with the controls interface.  The controls app will generate corrosponding CAN packets
based on the buttons you press.  The IC Sim sniffs the CAN and looks for relevant CAN packets that would change the
display.

Troubleshooting
---------------
* If you get an error about canplayer then you may not have can-utils properly installed and in your path.
* If the controller does not seem to be responding make sure the controls window is selected and active

## lib.o not linking
If lib.o doesn't link it's probably because it's the wrong arch for your platform.  To fix this you will
want to compile can-utils and copy the newly compiled lib.o to the icsim directory.  You can get can-utils
from: https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils

## read: Bad address
When running `./icsim vcan0` you end up getting a `read: Bad Address` message,
this is typically a result of needing to recompile with updated SDL libraries.
Make sure you have the recommended latest SDL2 libraries.  Some users have
reported fixing this problem by creating symlinks to the SDL.h files manually
or you could edit the Makefile and change the CFLAGS to point to wherever your
distro installs the SDL.h header, ie: /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/SDL2

There was also a report that on Arch linux needed sdl2_gfx library.

CAN Hacking Training Usage
--------------------------
To *safely* train on CAN hacking you can play back a sample recording included in this repo of generic CAN traffic.  This will
create something similar to normal CAN "noise".  Then start the IC Sim with the -r (randomize) switch.

```
  ./icsim -r vcan0
  Using CAN interface vcan0
  Seed: 1401717026
```

Now copy the seed number and paste it as the -s (seed) option for the controls.

```
  ./controls -s 1401717026 vcan0
```

This will randomize what CAN packets the IC needs and by passing the seed to the controls they will sync.  Randomizing
changes the arbitration IDs as well as the byte position of the packets used.  This will give you experience in hunting down
different types of CAN packets on the CAN Bus.

For the most realistic training you can change the difficulty levels.  Set the difficulty to 2 with the controls:

```
  ./controls -s 1401717026 -l 2 vcan0
```

This will add additional randomization to the target packets, simulating other data stored in the same arbitration id.
